# 05 - Brute Force
Systematically iterate all solution candidates until one satisfies the solution requirements.

On small enough inputs brute force might be feasible. We may also be able to use domain knowledge
to often greatly reduce the number of possible solution candidates.

Additionally **Backtracking** can be applied where partial candidate solutions exist. The order
in which one builds those partial solutions matters. (Think of solving a soduko where you always
choose the field with the smallest remaining possibility space next.)
