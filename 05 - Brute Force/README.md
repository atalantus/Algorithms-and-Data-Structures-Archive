# 05 - Brute Force
Technique of systematically iterating over all solution candidates until one satisfies the solution requirements.

## Application
On small enough inputs brute force might be feasible. We may also be able to use domain knowledge
to often greatly reduce the number of possible solution candidates.

## Usage
Additionally **Backtracking** can be applied where partial candidate solutions exist. The order
in which one builds those partial solutions matters. (Think of solving a soduko where you always
choose the field with the smallest remaining possibility space next.)
