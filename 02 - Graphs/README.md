## Graph Representations
- **Adjacency Matrix**: For each pair of vertices `u,v`, store existance of an edge `(u,v)âˆˆE`
- **Adjacency List**: For each vertex `v`, store a list of successors `vE`.

## Graph Traversal
A Graph Traversal algorithm visits vertices in a certain order possibly keeping track of additional information. 
DFS, BFS and TS all run in `O(|V| + |E|)` time and can also be used to efficiently check if a graph is connected (DFS, BFS, TS) or if a graph is cyclic (TS).

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
A MST is a subset of a connected graph such that this subset forms a tree (connected and acyclic) and the total sum of edge weights contained in this subset is minimal.

If a graph has negative edge weights we can find a MST by first adding a constant to every edge weight such that they become non-negative.

A **Maxmimum** Spanning Tree can be obtained by firstly inverting all edge weights of the graph and then finding the MST.

Since a MST is a tree it will always contain exactly `|V| - 1` edges.

## Shortest Path Problem
There are multiple different Shortest Path Problems: **Single Pair Shortest Path** (SPSP), **Single Source Shortest Path** (SSSP), **All Pairs Shortest Path** (APSP).

There are different algorithmic approaches depending on properties of the graph and the path problem.

For Example the SSSP on directed, acyclic graph can simply be found via Topological Sort and traversing nodes in topological order updating the distances to the source node. This takes `O(|V| + |E|)` time.

Even simpler is the SSSP on an unweighted graph which can simply be found via BST in also `O(|V| + |E|)` time.

Theoretically speaking all optimal SPSP algorithms also solve SSSP for the given source node within the same asymptotic time bound.
