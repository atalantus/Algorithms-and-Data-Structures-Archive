- ### [02.01 - Depth First Search (DFS)](02.01%20-%20Depth%20First%20Search%20(DFS))
    Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm starting at a node and exploring one branch as far as possible before backtracking.
- ### [02.02 - Breadth First Search (BFS](02.02%20-%20Breadth%20First%20Search%20(BFS))
    Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm starting at a node and explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
- ### [02.03 - Topological Sort](02.03%20-%20Topological%20Sort)
    Topological Sort is the problem of finding a topological order on a directed graph where any predecessor of a node is ordered before any of it's postdecessors.

## Graph Representations
- **Adjacency Matrix**: For each pair of vertices `u,v`, store existance of an edge `(u,v)âˆˆE`
- **Adjacency List**: For each vertex `v`, store a list of successors `vE`.

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## Longest Path Problem
